# **Team Rocket Weather App**
Software Tools and Emerging Tools for AI and ML Project..

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1. It is a simple website that displays current weather in Ontario and current Date/Time. It used two main APIs - Open weather map and date.now() function of JS. Also, this repo has CI/CD enabled that can be triggered on every commit changes.

Main application components are located in: **src/app folder**

## To set-up in your local machine

1. Install node modules by running `npm install`. This will store the @angular libraries inside /node_modules folder.
2. Build the app by running `npm build`.
3. Run `ng serve` to run it in http://localhost:4200/
4. If you get dependency error, install devkit by running: `npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular` 

## To test using Karma and Codecov

1. To run unit test on the app, execute: `ng test`. If you prefer to run test using headless chrome, you can execute `ng test --browsers=ChromeHeadlessNoSandbox --codeCoverage=true --watch=false.
2. From your terminal window, you will see the Code Coverage report generated by karma coverage istanbul.
3. Additionally, you may view the report in a more visual format by uploading it in Codecov with command: `codecov --disable=gcov -t <token>` 

## To build and deploy to Firebase
**Pre-requisite:** 
Set-up Firebase account and project from firebase console <br>

1. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
2. Ensure that all the static files (e.g index.html) are placed inside the dist/folder.
3. Install firebase tools including cli by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`
4. Login to Firebase by running `firebase login --interactive`
5. Initiate firebase by running `firebase init hosting`
6. Answer all the required items correcttly.
7. Edit firebase.json file and ensure that the public line shows `public:dist` given that step-2 is confirmed.
8. Run `npm run build`
9. Run `firebase deploy`

#### Alternatively, you may push the code here and the steps above will be performed automatically via Travis CI.

HEROKU URL (Dev): https://weather-swt.herokuapp.com/ 

## Additional Info: 

#### Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
